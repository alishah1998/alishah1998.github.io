There are also some dropdown questions that are used to gather data about the participants.\n\nHow are the questions ordered?\n\nThe first question (Q1) is giving the participants information about the survey and gaining consent from the participant. The next question (Q2) is a Bipolar scale seeing the participants attitude towards movies. They specifically question the participants about attitudes towards renting movies, different film ratings, social attitude towards movies, and software’s that controls explicit content.\nThe next question (Q3) is multiple choice, single answer regarding the hardware the participant may be willing to purchase.\nQ4 – Q6 are multiple-choice single answer questions regarding the participant’s interest in a software that controls explicit content and how much the participant believes it would cost and how much they are willing to pay for it.\nQ7 – Q10 are multiple-choice single answer questions regarding the participant’s preference over how they would purchase this software.\nQ11 – Q13 are multiple-choice single answer questions regarding how the participants choose to watch movies and how much they typically spend on movies.\nQ14 – Q18 are all demographic questions with Q14 and Q15 being multiple choice drop-down format while Q16-Q18 are regular multiple choice single answer question’s. \n\nWhat can be done to improve respondent’s experience?\n\nThe survey could be more mobile friendly. Users having to scroll from side to side can be frustrating and possibly accidentally cause the user to forget a question. Getting rid of the bipolar matrix scale and replacing it with a multiple-choice bipolar matrix would be easier for the user. The survey also repeats questions that were already asked, getting rid of the repeat questions could save time for the user."
